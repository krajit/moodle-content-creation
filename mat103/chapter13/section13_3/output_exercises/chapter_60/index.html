<p>Show that the curvature of a plane curve is <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa = |d\phi/ds|\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is the angle between <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{i}\)</span>; that is, <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is the angle of inclination of the
tangent line. (This shows that the definition of curvature is consistent
with the definition for plane curves given in Exercise 10.2.69.)</p>
