<p>A single curve C can be represented by more than one vector function.
For instance, the twisted cubic <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{r}_1(t) = \langle t, t^2, t^3 \rangle \qquad 1 \le t \le 2
\tag{4}
\]</span> could also be represented by the function <span
class="math display">\[
\mathbf{r}_2(u) = \langle e^u, e^{2u}, e^{3u} \rangle \qquad 0 \le u \le
\ln 2 \tag{5}
\]</span> where the connection between the parameters <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is given by <span
class="math inline">\(t=e^u\)</span>. We say that Equations 4 and 5 are
<strong>parametrizations</strong> of the curve C. If we were to use
Equation 3 to compute the length of C using Equations 4 and 5, we would
get the same answer. In general, it can be shown that when Equation 3 is
used to compute arc length, the answer is independent of the
parametrization that is used.</p>
<h3 id="the-arc-length-function">The Arc Length Function</h3>
<p>Now we suppose that C is a curve given by a vector function <span
class="math display">\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = f(t)\mathbf{i} + g(t)\mathbf{j} + h(t)\mathbf{k} \qquad
a \le t \le b
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}&#39;\)</span> is
continuous and C is traversed exactly once as <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> increases from <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. We define its <strong>arc length
function</strong> s by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
s(t) = \int_a^t |\mathbf{r}&#39;(u)| du = \int_a^t
\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{du}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{du}\right)^2 +
\left(\frac{dz}{du}\right)^2} du \tag{6}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span> is the length of the
part of C between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}(a)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}(t)\)</span>. (See Figure 3.) If
we differentiate both sides of Equation 6 using Part 1 of the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we obtain</p>
<p><img src="image-2.png" /></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{ds}{dt} = |\mathbf{r}&#39;(t)| \tag{7}
\]</span></p>
<p>It is often useful to <strong>parametrize a curve with respect to arc
length</strong> because arc length arises naturally from the shape of
the curve and does not depend on a particular coordinate system. If a
curve <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}(t)\)</span> is already
given in terms of a parameter <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span> is the arc length function
given by Equation 6, then we may be able to solve for <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as a function of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(t =
t(s)\)</span>. Then the curve can be reparametrized in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> by substituting for <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}
= \mathbf{r}(t(s))\)</span>. Thus, if <span
class="math inline">\(s=3\)</span> for instance, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}(t(3))\)</span> is the position vector
of the point 3 units of length along the curve from its starting
point.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 2</strong> Reparametrize the helix <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}(t) = \cos t \mathbf{i} + \sin t
\mathbf{j} + t \mathbf{k}\)</span> with respect to arc length measured
from <span class="math inline">\((1, 0, 0)\)</span> in the direction of
increasing <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> The initial point <span
class="math inline">\((1, 0, 0)\)</span> corresponds to the parameter
value <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. From Example 1 we have
<span class="math display">\[
\frac{ds}{dt} = |\mathbf{r}&#39;(t)| = \sqrt{2}
\]</span> and so <span class="math display">\[
s = s(t) = \int_0^t |\mathbf{r}&#39;(u)| du = \int_0^t \sqrt{2} du =
\sqrt{2}t
\]</span> Therefore <span class="math inline">\(t = s/\sqrt{2}\)</span>
and the required reparametrization is obtained by substituting for <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{r}(t(s)) = \cos(s/\sqrt{2})\mathbf{i} +
\sin(s/\sqrt{2})\mathbf{j} + (s/\sqrt{2})\mathbf{k}
\]</span></p>
