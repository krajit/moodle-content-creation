# Exercise 52

The view of the trefoil knot shown in Figure 8 is accurate, but it doesn't reveal the whole story. Use the parametric equations
$x = (2+\cos 1.5t)\cos t$
$y = (2+\cos 1.5t)\sin t$
$z = \sin 1.5t$
to sketch the curve by hand as viewed from above, with gaps indicating where the curve passes over itself. Start by showing that the projection of the curve onto the xy-plane has polar coordinates $r=2+\cos 1.5t$ and $\theta=t$, so $r$ varies between 1 and 3. Then show that $z$ has maximum and minimum values when the projection is halfway between $r=1$ and $r=3$.
When you have finished your sketch, use a computer to draw the curve with viewpoint directly above and compare with your sketch. Then use the computer to draw the curve from several other viewpoints. You can get a better impression of the curve if you plot a tube with radius 0.2 around the curve.
