<p>There is a close connection between continuous vector functions and
space curves. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> are continuous real-valued functions on
an interval <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. Then the set <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> of all points <span
class="math inline">\((x, y, z)\)</span> in space, where <span
class="math display">\[ x = f(t) \quad y = g(t) \quad z = h(t) \tag{2}
\]</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> varies throughout
the interval <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, is called a
<strong>space curve</strong>. The equations in (2) are called
<strong>parametric equations</strong> of <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is called a <strong>parameter</strong>.
We can think of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> as being traced
out by a moving particle whose position at time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\((f(t),
g(t), h(t))\)</span>. If we now consider the vector function <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle f(t), g(t), h(t)
\rangle\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}(t)\)</span> is the position vector of
the point <span class="math inline">\(P(f(t), g(t), h(t))\)</span> on
<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Thus any continuous vector
function <strong>r</strong> defines a space curve <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> that is traced out by the tip of the
moving vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}(t)\)</span>, as
shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 3</strong> Describe the curve defined by the vector
function <span class="math display">\[ \mathbf{r}(t) = \langle 1+t,
2+5t, -1+6t \rangle \]</span></p>

<div class="answer-block" style="display: none;">
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> The corresponding parametric equations are
<span class="math display">\[ x = 1+t \qquad y = 2+5t \qquad z = -1+6t
\]</span> which we recognize from Equations 12.5.2 as parametric
equations of a line passing through the point <span
class="math inline">\((1, 2, -1)\)</span> and parallel to the vector
<span class="math inline">\(\langle 1, 5, 6 \rangle\)</span>.
Alternatively, we could observe that the function can be written as
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_0 +
t\mathbf{v}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_0 =
\langle 1, 2, -1 \rangle\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v} = \langle 1, 5, 6 \rangle\)</span>, and
this is the vector equation of a line as given by Equation 12.5.1.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>Plane curves can also be represented in vector notation. For
instance, the curve given by the parametric equations <span
class="math inline">\(x = t^2 - 2t\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = t+1\)</span> could also be described by the
vector equation <span class="math display">\[ \mathbf{r}(t) = \langle
t^2 - 2t, t+1 \rangle = (t^2 - 2t)\mathbf{i} + (t+1)\mathbf{j} \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{i} = \langle 1, 0
\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{j} = \langle 0,
1 \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 4</strong> Sketch the curve whose vector equation is
<span class="math display">\[ \mathbf{r}(t) = \cos t \mathbf{i} + \sin t
\mathbf{j} + t \mathbf{k} \]</span></p>

<div class="answer-block" style="display: none;">
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> The parametric equations for this curve are
<span class="math display">\[ x = \cos t \qquad y = \sin t \qquad z = t
\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = \cos^2 t +
\sin^2 t = 1\)</span> for all values of <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the curve must lie on the circular
cylinder <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span>. The point
<span class="math inline">\((x, y, z)\)</span> lies directly above the
point <span class="math inline">\((x, y, 0)\)</span>, which moves
counterclockwise around the circle <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2
= 1\)</span> in the xy-plane. Since <span
class="math inline">\(z=t\)</span>, the curve spirals upward around the
cylinder as <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> increases. The curve,
shown in Figure 2, is called a <strong>helix</strong>.</p>

<hr />
<p>The corkscrew shape of the helix in Example 4 is familiar from its
occurrence in coiled springs. It also occurs in the model of DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic material of living cells). In 1953
James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the structure of the DNA
molecule is that of two linked, parallel helixes that are intertwined as
in Figure 3.</p>
