<p>We have already looked at two special types of surfaces: planes (in
Section 12.5) and spheres (in Section 12.1). Here we investigate two
other types of surfaces: cylinders and quadric surfaces.</p>
<p>In order to sketch the graph of a surface, it is useful to determine
the curves of intersection of the surface with planes parallel to the
coordinate planes. These curves are called <strong>traces</strong> (or
<strong>cross-sections</strong>) of the surface.</p>
<h3 id="cylinders">Cylinders</h3>
<hr />
<p>A <strong>cylinder</strong> is a surface that consists of all lines
(called <strong>rulings</strong>) that are parallel to a given line and
pass through a given plane curve.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1</strong> Sketch the graph of the surface <span
class="math inline">\(z = x^2\)</span>.</p>
<button class="btn btn-info" onclick="
  const ans = this.nextElementSibling;
  const isVisible = ans.style.display !== &#39;none&#39;;
  ans.style.display = isVisible ? &#39;none&#39; : &#39;block&#39;;
  this.innerText = isVisible ? &#39;Show Answer&#39; : &#39;Hide Answer&#39;;

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> Notice that the equation of the graph,
<span class="math inline">\(z = x^2\)</span>, doesnâ€™t involve <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. This means that any vertical plane
with equation <span class="math inline">\(y = k\)</span> (parallel to
the xz-plane) intersects the graph in a curve with equation <span
class="math inline">\(z = x^2\)</span>. So these vertical traces are
parabolas. Figure 1 shows how the graph is formed by taking the parabola
<span class="math inline">\(z = x^2\)</span> in the xz-plane and moving
it in the direction of the y-axis. The graph is a surface, called a
<strong>parabolic cylinder</strong>, made up of infinitely many shifted
copies of the same parabola. Here the rulings of the cylinder are
parallel to the y-axis.</p>
<p>We noticed that the variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
is missing from the equation of the cylinder in Example 1. This is
typical of a surface whose rulings are parallel to one of the coordinate
axes. If one of the variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is missing from the equation of a
surface, then the surface is a cylinder.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 2</strong> Identify and sketch the surfaces. (a)
<span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span> (b) <span
class="math inline">\(y^2 + z^2 = 1\)</span></p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> (a) Since <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is missing and the equations <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(z = k\)</span> represent a circle with radius 1 in
the plane <span class="math inline">\(z = k\)</span>, the surface <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span> is a circular cylinder
whose axis is the z-axis. (See Figure 2.) Here the rulings are vertical
lines.</p>

<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>In this case <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is missing and
the surface is a circular cylinder whose axis is the x-axis. (See Figure
3.) It is obtained by taking the circle <span class="math inline">\(y^2
+ z^2 = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> in the
yz-plane and moving it parallel to the x-axis.</li>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> When you are dealing with surfaces, it is
important to recognize that an equation like <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span> represents a cylinder and
not a circle. The trace of the cylinder <span class="math inline">\(x^2
+ y^2 = 1\)</span> in the xy-plane is the circle with equations <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0\)</span>.</p>
