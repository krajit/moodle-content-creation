<p>One use of projections occurs in physics in calculating
<strong>work</strong>. We know that the work done by a constant force
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> in moving an object through a
distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(W = Fd\)</span>, but this applies only when the
force is directed along the line of motion of the object. Suppose,
however, that the constant force is a vector <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F} = \vec{PR}\)</span> pointing in some
other direction, as in Figure 6. If the force moves the object from
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, then the displacement vector is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D} = \vec{PQ}\)</span>. The work done by
this force is defined to be the product of the component of the force
along <strong>D</strong> and the distance moved: <span
class="math display">\[
W = (|\mathbf{F}|\cos\theta)|\mathbf{D}|
\]</span> But then, from Theorem 3, we have <span
class="math display">\[
W = |\mathbf{F}||\mathbf{D}|\cos\theta = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{D}
\tag{12}
\]</span> Thus the work done by a constant force <strong>F</strong> is
the dot product <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F} \cdot
\mathbf{D}\)</span>, where <strong>D</strong> is the displacement
vector.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 7</strong> A wagon is pulled a distance of 100 m
along a horizontal path by a constant force of 70 N. The handle of the
wagon is held at an angle of <span
class="math inline">\(35^\circ\)</span> above the horizontal. Find the
work done by the force.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> If <strong>F</strong> and
<strong>D</strong> are the force and displacement vectors, as pictured
in Figure 7, then the work done is <span class="math display">\[
W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{D} = |\mathbf{F}||\mathbf{D}|\cos 35^\circ
= (70)(100)\cos 35^\circ \approx 5734 \text{ N} \cdot \text{m} = 5734
\text{ J}
\]</span></p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 8</strong> A force is given by a vector <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F} = 3\mathbf{i} + 4\mathbf{j} +
5\mathbf{k}\)</span> and moves a particle from the point <span
class="math inline">\(P(2, 1, 0)\)</span> to the point <span
class="math inline">\(Q(4, 6, 2)\)</span>. Find the work done.
<strong>SOLUTION</strong> The displacement vector is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D} = \vec{PQ} = \langle 2, 5, 2
\rangle\)</span>, so by Equation 12, the work done is <span
class="math display">\[
W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{D} = \langle 3, 4, 5 \rangle \cdot \langle
2, 5, 2 \rangle = 6 + 20 + 10 = 36
\]</span> If the unit of length is meters and the magnitude of the force
is measured in newtons, then the work done is 36 J.</p>
