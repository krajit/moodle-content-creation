<p>Suppose a particle moves from A to B, so its displacement vector is
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{AB}\)</span>. Then the particle changes
direction and moves from B to C, with displacement vector <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{BC}\)</span> as in Figure 2.</p>
<p><img src="image-1.png" /></p>
<p>The combined effect of these displacements is that the particle has
moved from A to C. The resulting displacement vector <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{AC}\)</span> is called the
<strong>sum</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{AB}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{BC}\)</span> and we write <span
class="math display">\[
\vec{AC} = \vec{AB} + \vec{BC}
\]</span> In general, if we start with vectors <strong>u</strong> and
<strong>v</strong>, we first move <strong>v</strong> so that its tail
coincides with the tip of <strong>u</strong> and define the sum of
<strong>u</strong> and <strong>v</strong> as follows.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Definition of Vector Addition</strong> If <strong>u</strong>
and <strong>v</strong> are vectors positioned so the initial point of
<strong>v</strong> is at the terminal point of <strong>u</strong>, then
the <strong>sum</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u} +
\mathbf{v}\)</span> is the vector from the initial point of
<strong>u</strong> to the terminal point of <strong>v</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The definition of vector addition is illustrated in Figure 3. You can
see why this definition is sometimes called the <strong>Triangle
Law</strong>.</p>

<hr />
<p>In Figure 4 we start with the same vectors <strong>u</strong> and
<strong>v</strong> as in Figure 3 and draw another copy of
<strong>v</strong> with the same initial point as <strong>u</strong>.
Completing the parallelogram, we see that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} +
\mathbf{u}\)</span>. This also gives another way to construct the sum:
if we place <strong>u</strong> and <strong>v</strong> so they start at
the same point, then <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u} +
\mathbf{v}\)</span> lies along the diagonal of the parallelogram with
<strong>u</strong> and <strong>v</strong> as sides. (This is called the
<strong>Parallelogram Law</strong>.)</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1</strong> Draw the sum of the vectors
<strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> shown in Figure 5.</p>
<p><img src="image-4.png" /></p>
<button class="btn btn-info" onclick="
  const ans = this.nextElementSibling;
  const isVisible = ans.style.display !== &#39;none&#39;;
  ans.style.display = isVisible ? &#39;none&#39; : &#39;block&#39;;
  this.innerText = isVisible ? &#39;Show Answer&#39; : &#39;Hide Answer&#39;;
">
Show Answer
</button>
<div class="answer-block" style="display: none;">
<p><img src="image-5.png" /></p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> First we move <strong>b</strong> and place
its tail at the tip of <strong>a</strong>, being careful to draw a copy
of <strong>b</strong> that has the same length and direction. Then we
draw the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a} +
\mathbf{b}\)</span> [see Figure 6(a)] starting at the initial point of
<strong>a</strong> and ending at the terminal point of the copy of
<strong>b</strong>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could place <strong>b</strong> so it starts where
<strong>a</strong> starts and construct <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\)</span> by the
Parallelogram Law as in Figure 6(b).</p>
