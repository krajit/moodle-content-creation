<p>For some purposes it’s best to introduce a coordinate system and
treat vectors algebraically. If we place the initial point of a vector
<strong>a</strong> at the origin of a rectangular coordinate system,
then the terminal point of <strong>a</strong> has coordinates of the
form <span class="math inline">\((a_1, a_2)\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\((a_1, a_2, a_3)\)</span>, depending on whether our
coordinate system is two- or three-dimensional (see Figure 11).</p>
<p><img src="image-10.png" /></p>
<p>These coordinates are called the <strong>components</strong> of
<strong>a</strong> and we write <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{a} = \langle a_1, a_2 \rangle \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{a} =
\langle a_1, a_2, a_3 \rangle
\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>We use the notation <span class="math inline">\(\langle a_1, a_2
\rangle\)</span> for the ordered pair that refers to a vector so as not
to confuse it with the ordered pair <span class="math inline">\((a_1,
a_2)\)</span> that refers to a point in the plane.</p>
<p><img src="image-11.png" /></p>
<p>For instance, the vectors shown in Figure 12 are all equivalent to
the vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{OP} = \langle 3, 2
\rangle\)</span> whose terminal point is <span
class="math inline">\(P(3, 2)\)</span>. What they have in common is that
the terminal point is reached from the initial point by a displacement
of three units to the right and two upward. We can think of all these
geometric vectors as representations of the algebraic vector <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a} = \langle 3, 2 \rangle\)</span>. The
particular representation <span class="math inline">\(\vec{OP}\)</span>
from the origin to the point <span class="math inline">\(P(3,
2)\)</span> is called the <strong>position vector</strong> of the point
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<p>In three dimensions, the vector <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a} = \vec{OP} = \langle a_1, a_2, a_3
\rangle\)</span> is the <strong>position vector</strong> of the point
<span class="math inline">\(P(a_1, a_2, a_3)\)</span>. (See Figure
13.)</p>
<p><img src="image-12.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s consider any other representation <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{AB}\)</span> of <strong>a</strong>, where the
initial point is <span class="math inline">\(A(x_1, y_1, z_1)\)</span>
and the terminal point is <span class="math inline">\(B(x_2, y_2,
z_2)\)</span>. Then we must have <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + a_1 =
x_2, y_1 + a_2 = y_2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_1 + a_3
= z_2\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(a_1 = x_2 - x_1, a_2 =
y_2 - y_1,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_3 = z_2 -
z_1\)</span>. Thus we have the following result.</p>
<hr />
<p>Given the points <span class="math inline">\(A(x_1, y_1,
z_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B(x_2, y_2, z_2)\)</span>,
the vector <strong>a</strong> with representation <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{AB}\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{a} = \langle x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1 \rangle
\tag{1}
\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 3</strong> Find the vector represented by the
directed line segment with initial point <span
class="math inline">\(A(2, -3, 4)\)</span> and terminal point <span
class="math inline">\(B(-2, 1, 1)\)</span>.</p>
