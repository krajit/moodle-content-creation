<p>Three forces act on an object. Two of the forces are at an angle of
<span class="math inline">\(100^\circ\)</span> to each other and have
magnitudes 25 N and 12 N. The third is perpendicular to the plane of
these two forces and has magnitude 4 N. Calculate the magnitude of the
force that would exactly counterbalance these three forces.</p>
