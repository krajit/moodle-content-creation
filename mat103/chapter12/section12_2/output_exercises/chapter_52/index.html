<p>Suppose the three coordinate planes are all mirrored and a light ray
given by the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a} = \langle
a_1, a_2, a_3 \rangle\)</span> first strikes the xz-plane, as shown in
the figure. Use the fact that the angle of incidence equals the angle of
reflection to show that the direction of the reflected ray is given by
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{b} = \langle a_1, -a_2, a_3
\rangle\)</span>. Deduce that, after being reflected by all three
mutually perpendicular mirrors, the resulting ray is parallel to the
initial ray.</p>
