<p>Two tanks are participating in a battle simulation. Tank A is at
point <span class="math inline">\((325, 810, 561)\)</span> and tank B is
positioned at point <span class="math inline">\((765, 675,
599)\)</span>. (a) Find parametric equations for the line of sight
between the tanks. (b) If we divide the line of sight into 5 equal
segments, the elevations of the terrain at the four intermediate points
from tank A to tank B are 549, 566, 586, and 589. Can the tanks see each
other?</p>
