<p>A line in the xy-plane is determined when a point on the line and the
direction of the line (its slope or angle of inclination) are given. The
equation of the line can then be written using the point-slope form.</p>
<p><img src="image.png" /></p>
<p>Likewise, a line L in three-dimensional space is determined when we
know a point <span class="math inline">\(P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)\)</span> on
L and the direction of L. In three dimensions the direction of a line is
conveniently described by a vector, so we let <strong>v</strong> be a
vector parallel to L. Let <span class="math inline">\(P(x, y,
z)\)</span> be an arbitrary point on L and let <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_0\)</span> and <strong>r</strong> be
the position vectors of <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (that is, they have
representations <span class="math inline">\(\vec{OP_0}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{OP}\)</span>). If <strong>a</strong> is
the vector with representation <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{P_0P}\)</span>, as in Figure 1, then the
Triangle Law for vector addition gives <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_0 + \mathbf{a}\)</span>.
But, since <strong>a</strong> and <strong>v</strong> are parallel
vectors, there is a scalar <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a} = t\mathbf{v}\)</span>. Thus
<span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_0 + t\mathbf{v}
\tag{1}
\]</span> which is a <strong>vector equation</strong> of L. Each value
of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> gives the
position vector <strong>r</strong> of a point on L. In other words, as
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> varies, the line is traced out by
the tip of the vector <strong>r</strong>. As Figure 2 indicates,
positive values of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> correspond to
points on L that lie on one side of <span
class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, whereas negative values of <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> correspond to points that lie on the
other side of <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="image-1.png" /></p>
<p>If the vector <strong>v</strong> that gives the direction of the line
L is written in component form as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}
= \langle a, b, c \rangle\)</span>, then we have <span
class="math inline">\(t\mathbf{v} = \langle ta, tb, tc \rangle\)</span>.
We can also write <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r} = \langle x, y,
z \rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_0 =
\langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle\)</span>, so the vector equation (1)
becomes <span class="math display">\[
\langle x, y, z \rangle = \langle x_0 + ta, y_0 + tb, z_0 + tc \rangle
\]</span> Two vectors are equal if and only if corresponding components
are equal. Therefore we have the three scalar equations: <span
class="math display">\[
x = x_0 + at \quad y = y_0 + bt \quad z = z_0 + ct
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>.
These equations are called <strong>parametric equations</strong> of the
line L through the point <span class="math inline">\(P_0(x_0, y_0,
z_0)\)</span> and parallel to the vector <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v} = \langle a, b, c \rangle\)</span>.
Each value of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> gives
a point <span class="math inline">\((x, y, z)\)</span> on L.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Parametric equations</strong> for a line through the point
<span class="math inline">\((x_0, y_0, z_0)\)</span> and parallel to the
direction vector <span class="math inline">\(\langle a, b, c
\rangle\)</span> are <span class="math display">\[
x = x_0 + at \quad y = y_0 + bt \quad z = z_0 + ct
\tag{2}
\]</span></p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1</strong> (a) Find a vector equation and parametric
equations for the line that passes through the point <span
class="math inline">\((5, 1, 3)\)</span> and is parallel to the vector
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{i} + 4\mathbf{j} -
2\mathbf{k}\)</span>. (b) Find two other points on the line.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> (a) Here <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}_0 = \langle 5, 1, 3 \rangle =
5\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j} + 3\mathbf{k}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{i} + 4\mathbf{j} -
2\mathbf{k}\)</span>, so the vector equation (1) becomes <span
class="math display">\[
\mathbf{r} = (5\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j} + 3\mathbf{k}) + t(\mathbf{i} +
4\mathbf{j} - 2\mathbf{k})
\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{r} = (5 + t)\mathbf{i} + (1 + 4t)\mathbf{j} + (3 - 2t)\mathbf{k}
\]</span> Parametric equations are <span class="math display">\[
x = 5 + t \quad y = 1 + 4t \quad z = 3 - 2t
\]</span> (b) Choosing the parameter value <span class="math inline">\(t
= 1\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(x = 6, y = 5,\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(z = 1\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\((6, 5, 1)\)</span> is a point on the line.
Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(t = -1\)</span> gives the point
<span class="math inline">\((4, -3, 5)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The vector equation and parametric equations of a line are not
unique. If we change the point or the parameter or choose a different
parallel vector, then the equations change. For instance, if, instead of
<span class="math inline">\((5, 1, 3)\)</span>, we choose the point
<span class="math inline">\((6, 5, 1)\)</span> in Example 1, then the
parametric equations of the line become <span class="math display">\[
x = 6 + t \quad y = 5 + 4t \quad z = 1 - 2t
\]</span> Or, if we stay with the point <span class="math inline">\((5,
1, 3)\)</span> but choose the parallel vector <span
class="math inline">\(2\mathbf{i} + 8\mathbf{j} - 4\mathbf{k}\)</span>,
we arrive at the equations <span class="math display">\[
x = 5 + 2t \quad y = 1 + 8t \quad z = 3 - 4t
\]</span> In general, if a vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}
= \langle a, b, c \rangle\)</span> is used to describe the direction of
a line L, then the numbers <span class="math inline">\(a, b,\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are called <strong>direction
numbers</strong> of L. Since any vector parallel to <strong>v</strong>
could also be used, we see that any three numbers proportional to <span
class="math inline">\(a, b,\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> could also be used as a set of
direction numbers for L.</p>
<p>Another way of describing a line L is to eliminate the parameter
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> from Equations 2. If none of
<span class="math inline">\(a, b,\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is 0, we can solve each of these
equations for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[
t = \frac{x - x_0}{a} \quad t = \frac{y - y_0}{b} \quad t = \frac{z -
z_0}{c}
\]</span> Equating the results, we obtain <span class="math display">\[
\frac{x - x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}
\tag{3}
\]</span> These equations are called <strong>symmetric
equations</strong> of L. Notice that the numbers <span
class="math inline">\(a, b,\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> that appear in the denominators of
Equations 3 are direction numbers of L, that is, components of a vector
parallel to L. If one of <span class="math inline">\(a, b,\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is 0, we can still eliminate
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. For instance, if <span
class="math inline">\(a = 0\)</span>, we could write the equations of L
as <span class="math display">\[
x = x_0 \quad \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}
\]</span> This means that L lies in the vertical plane <span
class="math inline">\(x = x_0\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> (a) We are not explicitly given a vector
parallel to the line, but observe that the vector <strong>v</strong>
with representation <span class="math inline">\(\vec{AB}\)</span> is
parallel to the line and <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{v} = \langle 3 - 2, -1 - 4, 1 - (-3) \rangle = \langle 1, -5, 4
\rangle
\]</span> Thus direction numbers are <span class="math inline">\(a = 1,
b = -5,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c = 4\)</span>. Taking
the point <span class="math inline">\((2, 4, -3)\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, we see that parametric equations (2)
are <span class="math display">\[
x = 2 + t \quad y = 4 - 5t \quad z = -3 + 4t
\]</span> and symmetric equations (3) are <span class="math display">\[
\frac{x - 2}{1} = \frac{y - 4}{-5} = \frac{z + 3}{4}
\]</span> (b) The line intersects the xy-plane when <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0\)</span>, so we put <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0\)</span> in the symmetric equations and
obtain <span class="math display">\[
\frac{x - 2}{1} = \frac{y - 4}{-5} = \frac{3}{4}
\]</span> This gives <span class="math inline">\(x =
\frac{11}{4}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y =
\frac{1}{4}\)</span>, so the line intersects the xy-plane at the point
<span class="math inline">\((\frac{11}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, 0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, the procedure of Example 2 shows that direction numbers
of the line L through the points <span class="math inline">\(P_0(x_0,
y_0, z_0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_1(x_1, y_1,
z_1)\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(x_1 - x_0, y_1 -
y_0,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_1 - z_0\)</span> and so
symmetric equations of L are <span class="math display">\[
\frac{x - x_0}{x_1 - x_0} = \frac{y - y_0}{y_1 - y_0} = \frac{z -
z_0}{z_1 - z_0}
\]</span></p>
