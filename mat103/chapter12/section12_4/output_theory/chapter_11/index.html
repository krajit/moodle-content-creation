<p>The idea of a cross product occurs often in physics. In particular,
we consider a force <strong>F</strong> acting on a rigid body at a point
given by a position vector <strong>r</strong>. The
<strong>torque</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\tau}\)</span> (relative to the origin) is
defined to be the cross product of the position and force vectors <span
class="math display">\[
\mathbf{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}
\]</span> and measures the tendency of the body to rotate about the
origin. The direction of the torque vector indicates the axis of
rotation. According to Theorem 9, the magnitude of the torque vector is
<span class="math display">\[
|\mathbf{\tau}| = |\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}| =
|\mathbf{r}||\mathbf{F}|\sin\theta
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle
between the position and force vectors. Observe that the only component
of <strong>F</strong> that can cause a rotation is the one perpendicular
to <strong>r</strong>, that is, <span
class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{F}|\sin\theta\)</span>. The magnitude of
the torque is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by
<strong>r</strong> and <strong>F</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 6</strong> A bolt is tightened by applying a 40-N
force to a 0.25-m wrench as shown in Figure 5. Find the magnitude of the
torque about the center of the bolt.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> The magnitude of the torque vector is <span
class="math display">\[
|\mathbf{\tau}| = |\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}| =
|\mathbf{r}||\mathbf{F}|\sin 75^\circ = (0.25)(40)\sin 75^\circ = 10
\sin 75^\circ \approx 9.66 \text{ N}\cdot\text{m}
\]</span> If the bolt is right-threaded, then the torque vector itself
is <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{\tau} = |\mathbf{\tau}|\mathbf{n} \approx 9.66\mathbf{n}
\]</span> where <strong>n</strong> is a unit vector directed down into
the page (by the right-hand rule).</p>
