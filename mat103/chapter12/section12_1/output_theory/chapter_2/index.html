<p>In two-dimensional analytic geometry, the graph of an equation
involving <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is a curve in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>. In three-dimensional
analytic geometry, an equation in <span class="math inline">\(x,
y,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> represents a
<strong>surface</strong> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1</strong> What surfaces in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> are represented by the
following equations? (a) <span class="math inline">\(z = 3\)</span> (b)
<span class="math inline">\(y = 5\)</span></p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> (a) The equation <span
class="math inline">\(z = 3\)</span> represents the set <span
class="math inline">\(\{(x, y, z) | z = 3\}\)</span>, which is the set
of all points in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> whose
z-coordinate is 3 (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can each be any value). This is the
horizontal plane that is parallel to the xy-plane and three units above
it as in Figure 7(a).</p>

<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>The equation <span class="math inline">\(y = 5\)</span> represents
the set of all points in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> whose y-coordinate is 5.
This is the vertical plane that is parallel to the xz-plane and five
units to the right of it as in Figure 7(b).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> When an equation is given, we must understand
from the context whether it represents a curve in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> or a surface in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>. In Example 1, <span
class="math inline">\(y = 5\)</span> represents a plane in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, but of course <span
class="math inline">\(y = 5\)</span> can also represent a line in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> if we are dealing with
two-dimensional analytic geometry. See Figure 7(b) and (c).</p>

<hr />
<p>In general, if <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a constant,
then <span class="math inline">\(x = k\)</span> represents a plane
parallel to the yz-plane, <span class="math inline">\(y = k\)</span> is
a plane parallel to the xz-plane, and <span class="math inline">\(z =
k\)</span> is a plane parallel to the xy-plane. In Figure 5, the faces
of the rectangular box are formed by the three coordinate planes <span
class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> (the yz-plane), <span
class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span> (the xz-plane), and <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0\)</span> (the xy-plane), and the planes
<span class="math inline">\(x = a, y = b,\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z = c\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 2</strong> (a) Which points <span
class="math inline">\((x, y, z)\)</span> satisfy the equations <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z = 3\)</span>? (b) What does the equation <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span> represent as a surface in
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>?</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> (a) Because <span class="math inline">\(z =
3\)</span>, the points lie in the horizontal plane <span
class="math inline">\(z = 3\)</span> from Example 1(a). Because <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span>, the points lie on the
circle with radius 1 and center on the z-axis. See Figure 8. (b) Given
that <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span>, with no
restrictions on <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, we see that the
point <span class="math inline">\((x, y, z)\)</span> could lie on a
circle in any horizontal plane <span class="math inline">\(z =
k\)</span>. So the surface <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 =
1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> consists
of all possible horizontal circles <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2
= 1, z = k\)</span>, and is therefore the circular cylinder with radius
1 whose axis is the z-axis. See Figure 9.</p>

<div class="answer-block" style="display: none;">
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> The equation represents the set of all
points in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> whose x- and
y-coordinates are equal, that is, <span class="math inline">\(\{(x, x,
z) | x \in \mathbb{R}, z \in \mathbb{R}\}\)</span>. This is a vertical
plane that intersects the xy-plane in the line <span
class="math inline">\(y = x, z = 0\)</span>. The portion of this plane
that lies in the first octant is sketched in Figure 10.</p>
