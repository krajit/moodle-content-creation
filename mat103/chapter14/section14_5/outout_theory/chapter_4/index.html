<p>To remember the Chain Rule, itâ€™s helpful to draw the <strong>tree
diagram</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="image-2.png" /></p>
<p>We draw branches from the dependent variable <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> to the intermediate variables <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to indicate that <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is a function of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Then we draw branches from <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to the independent variables <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. On each branch we write the
corresponding partial derivative. To find <span
class="math inline">\(\partial z / \partial s\)</span>, we find the
product of the partial derivatives along each path from <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and then add these products: <span
class="math display">\[ \frac{\partial z}{\partial s} = \frac{\partial
z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} + \frac{\partial
z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial s} \]</span> Similarly, we
find <span class="math inline">\(\partial z / \partial t\)</span> by
using the paths from <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we consider the general situation in which a dependent variable
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a function of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> intermediate variables <span
class="math inline">\(x_1, ..., x_n\)</span>, each of which is, in turn,
a function of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> independent
variables <span class="math inline">\(t_1, ..., t_m\)</span>. Notice
that there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> terms, one for
each intermediate variable. The proof is similar to that of Case 1.</p>
