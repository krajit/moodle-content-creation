<p>The voltage <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in a simple
electrical circuit is slowly decreasing as the battery wears out. The
resistance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is slowly increasing
as the resistor heats up. Use Ohmâ€™s Law, <span class="math inline">\(V =
IR\)</span>, to find how the current <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is changing at the moment when <span
class="math inline">\(R = 400\ \Omega\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(I = 0.08\)</span> A, <span
class="math inline">\(dV/dt = -0.01\)</span> V/s, and <span
class="math inline">\(dR/dt = 0.03\ \Omega\)</span>/s.</p>
