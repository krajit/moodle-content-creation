<p>A manufacturer has modeled its yearly production function <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (the value of its entire production, in
millions of dollars) as a Cobb-Douglas function <span
class="math inline">\(P(L, K) = 1.47L^{0.65}K^{0.35}\)</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the number of labor hours (in
thousands) and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the invested
capital (in millions of dollars). Suppose that when <span
class="math inline">\(L = 30\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K
= 8\)</span>, the labor force is decreasing at a rate of 2000 labor
hours per year and capital is increasing at a rate of $500,000 per year.
Find the rate of change of production.</p>
