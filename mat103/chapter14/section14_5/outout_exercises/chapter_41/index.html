<p>The pressure of 1 mole of an ideal gas is increasing at a rate of
0.05 kPa/s and the temperature is increasing at a rate of 0.15 K/s. Use
the equation <span class="math inline">\(PV = 8.31T\)</span> in Example
2 to find the rate of change of the volume when the pressure is 20 kPa
and the temperature is 320 K.</p>
