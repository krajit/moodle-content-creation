<p>The pressure, volume, and temperature of a mole of an ideal gas are
related by the equation <span class="math inline">\(PV = 8.31T\)</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is measured in kilopascals,
<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in liters, and <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in kelvins. Use differentials to find
the approximate change in the pressure if the volume increases from 12 L
to 12.3 L and the temperature decreases from 310 K to 305 K.</p>
