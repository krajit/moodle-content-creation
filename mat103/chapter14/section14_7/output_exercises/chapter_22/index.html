<p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y) =
x^2ye^{-x^2-y^2}\)</span> has maximum values at <span
class="math inline">\((\pm 1, 1/\sqrt{2})\)</span> and minimum values at
<span class="math inline">\((\pm 1, -1/\sqrt{2})\)</span>. Show also
that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has infinitely many other
critical points and <span class="math inline">\(D = 0\)</span> at each
of them. Which of them give rise to maximum values? Minimum values?
Saddle points?</p>
