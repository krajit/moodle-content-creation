<p>The Shannon index is a measure of diversity in an ecosystem. For the
case of three species, it is defined as <span class="math inline">\(H =
-p_1 \ln p_1 - p_2 \ln p_2 - p_3 \ln p_3\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is the proportion of species i in the
ecosystem. (a) Express H as a function of two variables <span
class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p_2\)</span> using the fact that <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1\)</span>. (b) What is the
domain of H? (c) Find the maximum value of H. For what values of <span
class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2, p_3\)</span> does it occur?</p>
