<p>For functions of one variable it is impossible for a continuous
function to have two local maxima and no local minimum. But for
functions of two variables such functions exist. Show that the function
<span class="math inline">\(f(x, y) = -(x^2 - 1)^2 - (x^2y - x -
1)^2\)</span> has only two critical points, but has local maxima at both
of them. Then use a computer to produce a graph with a carefully chosen
domain and viewpoint to see how this is possible.</p>
