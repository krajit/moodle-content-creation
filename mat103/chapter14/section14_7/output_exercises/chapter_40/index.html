<p>If a function of one variable is continuous on an interval and has
only one critical number, then a local maximum has to be an absolute
maximum. But this is not true for functions of two variables. Show that
the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y) = 3xe^y - x^3 -
e^{3y}\)</span> has exactly one critical point, and that f has a local
maximum there that is not an absolute maximum. Then use a computer to
produce a graph with a carefully chosen domain and viewpoint to see how
this is possible.</p>
