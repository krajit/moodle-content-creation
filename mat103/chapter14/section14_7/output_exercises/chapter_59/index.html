<p>Suppose that a scientist has reason to believe that two quantities x
and y are related linearly, that is, <span class="math inline">\(y = mx
+ b\)</span>, at least approximately, for some values of m and b. The
scientist performs an experiment and collects data in the form of points
<span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n,
y_n)\)</span>, and then plots these points. The points don’t lie exactly
on a straight line, so the scientist wants to find constants m and b so
that the line <span class="math inline">\(y = mx + b\)</span> “fits” the
points as well as possible.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(d_i = y_i - (mx_i + b)\)</span> be
the vertical deviation of the point <span class="math inline">\((x_i,
y_i)\)</span> from the line. The method of least squares determines m
and b so as to minimize <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n
d_i^2\)</span>, the sum of the squares of these deviations. Show that,
according to this method, the line of best fit is obtained when <span
class="math inline">\(m \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + bn = \sum_{i=1}^n
y_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + b
\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i\)</span> Thus the line is found
by solving these two equations in the two unknowns m and b.</p>
