<p>For a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of one
variable, the Extreme Value Theorem says that if <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous on a closed interval
<span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has an absolute minimum value and an
absolute maximum value. According to the Closed Interval Method, we
found these by evaluating <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> not
only at the critical numbers but also at the endpoints <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="image-7.png" /></p>
<p>There is a similar situation for functions of two variables. Just as
a closed interval contains its endpoints, a <strong>closed set</strong>
in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> is one that
contains all its boundary points. [A <strong>boundary point</strong> of
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is a point <span
class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> such that every disk with center
<span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> contains points in <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and also points not in <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.] For instance, the disk</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
D = \{(x, y) | x^2 + y^2 \le 1\}
\]</span></p>
<p>which consists of all points on or inside the circle <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span>, is a closed set because it
contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle
<span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)</span>). But if even one
point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would not be
closed.</p>
<p>A <strong>bounded set</strong> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> is one that is contained
within some disk. In other words, it is finite in extent. Then, in terms
of closed and bounded sets, we can state the following counterpart of
the Extreme Value Theorem in two dimensions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Extreme Value Theorem for Functions of Two Variables</strong>
If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous on a closed,
bounded set <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> attains an absolute maximum value <span
class="math inline">\(f(x_1, y_1)\)</span> and an absolute minimum value
<span class="math inline">\(f(x_2, y_2)\)</span> at some points <span
class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((x_2, y_2)\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>To find the extreme values guaranteed by Theorem, we note that, by a
previous Theorem , if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has an
extreme value at <span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1)\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\((x_1, y_1)\)</span> is either a critical
point of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> or a boundary point of
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Thus we have the following
extension of the Closed Interval Method.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Steps to find Absolute Min-max</strong></p>
<p>To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous
function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on a closed, bounded set
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>: 1. Find the values of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at the critical points of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. 2. Find the extreme values of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on the boundary of <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. 3. The largest of the values from
steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; the smallest of these
values is the absolute minimum value.</p>
