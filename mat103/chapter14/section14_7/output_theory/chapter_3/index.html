<p><strong>Theorem</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
has a local maximum or minimum at <span class="math inline">\((a,
b)\)</span> and the first-order partial derivatives of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> exist there, then <span
class="math inline">\(f_x(a, b) = 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f_y(a, b) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>PROOF</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = f(x,
b)\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a local
maximum (or minimum) at <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span>,
then <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> has a local maximum (or
minimum) at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(g&#39;(a) = 0\)</span> by Fermat’s Theorem. But
<span class="math inline">\(g&#39;(a) = f_x(a, b)\)</span> and so <span
class="math inline">\(f_x(a, b) = 0\)</span>. Similarly, by applying
Fermat’s Theorem to the function <span class="math inline">\(G(y) = f(a,
y)\)</span>, we obtain <span class="math inline">\(f_y(a, b) =
0\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Notice that the conclusion of Theorem 2 can be stated in the notation
of gradient vectors as <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f(a, b) =
\mathbf{0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we put <span class="math inline">\(f_x(a, b) = 0\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(f_y(a, b) = 0\)</span> in the equation of a
tangent plane, we get <span class="math inline">\(z = z_0\)</span>. Thus
the geometric interpretation of Theorem 2 is that if the graph of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a tangent plane at a local maximum
or minimum, then the tangent plane must be horizontal.</p>
