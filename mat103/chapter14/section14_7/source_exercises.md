# Exercise 59

Suppose that a scientist has reason to believe that two quantities x and y are related linearly, that is, $y = mx + b$, at least approximately, for some values of m and b. The scientist performs an experiment and collects data in the form of points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, and then plots these points. The points don't lie exactly on a straight line, so the scientist wants to find constants m and b so that the line $y = mx + b$ "fits" the points as well as possible.


![](image-13.png)

Let $d_i = y_i - (mx_i + b)$ be the vertical deviation of the point $(x_i, y_i)$ from the line. The method of least squares determines m and b so as to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2$, the sum of the squares of these deviations. Show that, according to this method, the line of best fit is obtained when
$m \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + bn = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$
and
$m \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + b \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i$
Thus the line is found by solving these two equations in the two unknowns m and b.
