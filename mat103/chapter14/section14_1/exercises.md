# Exercise 1

In Example 2 we considered the function $W = f(T, v)$, where $W$ is the wind-chill index, $T$ is the actual temperature, and $v$ is the wind speed. A numerical representation is given in Table 1 on page 889.

(b) Describe in words the meaning of the question “For what value of $v$ is $f(-20, v) = -30$?” Then answer the question.  
(c) Describe in words the meaning of the question “For what value of $T$ is $f(T, 20) = -49$?” Then answer the question.  
(d) What is the meaning of the function $W = f(-5, v)$? Describe the behavior of this function.

# Exercise 2

The temperature-humidity index $I$ (or humidex, for short) is the perceived air temperature when the actual temperature is $T$ and the relative humidity is $h$, so we can write $I = f(T, h)$. The following table of values of $I$ is an excerpt from a table compiled by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.

(a) What is the value of $f(95, 70)$? What is its meaning?  
(b) For what value of $h$ is $f(90, h) = 100$?  
(c) For what value of $T$ is $f(T, 50) = 88$?  
(d) What are the meanings of the functions $I = f(80, h)$ and $I = f(100, h)$? Compare the behavior of these two functions of $h$.

# Exercise 3

A manufacturer has modeled its yearly production function $P$ (the monetary value of its entire production in millions of dollars) as a Cobb-Douglas function  
$$P(L, K) = 1.47L^{0.65}K^{0.35}$$  
where $L$ is the number of labor hours (in thousands) and $K$ is the invested capital (in millions of dollars). Find $P(120, 20)$ and interpret it.

</page>

# Exercise 4

Verify for the Cobb-Douglas production function  
$$P(L, K) = 1.01L^{0.75}K^{0.25}$$  
discussed in Example 3 that the production will be doubled if both the amount of labor and the amount of capital are doubled. Determine whether this is also true for the general production function  
$$P(L, K) = bL^rK^{1 - r}$$

# Exercise 5

A model for the surface area of a human body is given by the function  
$$S = f(w, h) = 0.1091w^{0.425}h^{0.725}$$  
where $w$ is the weight (in pounds), $h$ is the height (in inches), and $S$ is measured in square feet.  
(a) Find $f(160, 70)$ and interpret it.  
(b) What is your own surface area?

# Exercise 6

The wind-chill index $W$ discussed in Example 2 has been modeled by the following function:

Check to see how closely this model agrees with the values in Table 1 for a few values of $T$ and $v$.

# Exercise 7

The wave heights $h$ in the open sea depend on the speed $v$ of the wind and the length of time $t$ that the wind has been blowing at that speed. Values of the function $h = f(v, t)$ are recorded in feet in Table 4.  
(a) What is the value of $f(40, 15)$? What is its meaning?  
(b) What is the meaning of the function $h = f(30, t)$? Describe the behavior of this function.
