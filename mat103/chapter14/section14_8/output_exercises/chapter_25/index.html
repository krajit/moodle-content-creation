<p>Consider the problem of maximizing the function <span
class="math inline">\(f(x, y) = 2x + 3y\)</span> subject to the
constraint <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} = 5\)</span>.
(a) Try using Lagrange multipliers to solve the problem. (b) Does <span
class="math inline">\(f(25, 0)\)</span> give a larger value than the one
in part (a)? (c) Solve the problem by graphing the constraint curve and
several level curves of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. (d)
Explain why the method of Lagrange multipliers fails to solve the
problem. (e) What is the significance of <span
class="math inline">\(f(9, 4)\)</span>?</p>
