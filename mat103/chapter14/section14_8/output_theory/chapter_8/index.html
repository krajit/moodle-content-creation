<p>Suppose now that we want to find the maximum and minimum values of a
function <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y, z)\)</span> subject to
<strong>two</strong> constraints (side conditions) of the form <span
class="math inline">\(g(x, y, z) = k\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(h(x, y, z) = c\)</span>. Geometrically, this means
that we are looking for the extreme values of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\((x, y,
z)\)</span> is restricted to lie on the curve of intersection <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> of the level surfaces <span
class="math inline">\(g(x, y, z) = k\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(h(x, y, z) = c\)</span>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has such an extreme value at a point
<span class="math inline">\(P(x_0, y_0, z_0)\)</span>. We know that
<span class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> is orthogonal to <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. But we also know that <span
class="math inline">\(\nabla g\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\nabla h\)</span> are orthogonal to <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> at <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. This means that the gradient vector
<span class="math inline">\(\nabla f(x_0, y_0, z_0)\)</span> is in the
plane determined by <span class="math inline">\(\nabla g(x_0, y_0,
z_0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla h(x_0, y_0,
z_0)\)</span>. (We assume that these gradient vectors are not zero and
not parallel.) So there are numbers <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> (called Lagrange multipliers) such
that <span class="math display">\[
\nabla f(x_0, y_0, z_0) = \lambda \nabla g(x_0, y_0, z_0) + \mu \nabla
h(x_0, y_0, z_0)
\]</span> In this case Lagrangeâ€™s method is to look for extreme values
by solving five equations in the five unknowns <span
class="math inline">\(x, y, z, \lambda,\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. These equations are obtained by
writing Equation 16 in terms of its components and using the constraint
equations: <span class="math display">\[
f_x = \lambda g_x + \mu h_x
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
f_y = \lambda g_y + \mu h_y
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
f_z = \lambda g_z + \mu h_z
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
g(x, y, z) = k
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
h(x, y, z) = c
\]</span></p>
