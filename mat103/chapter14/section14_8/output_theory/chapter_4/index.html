<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> As in Example 14.7.6, we let <span
class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> be the length, width, and height,
respectively, of the box in meters. Then we wish to maximize <span
class="math display">\[
V = xyz
\]</span> subject to the constraint <span class="math display">\[
g(x, y, z) = 2xz + 2yz + xy = 12
\]</span> Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we look for values
of <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\nabla V = \lambda \nabla g\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g(x, y, z) = 12\)</span>. This gives the equations
<span class="math display">\[
V_x = \lambda g_x \quad V_y = \lambda g_y \quad V_z = \lambda g_z \quad
2xz + 2yz + xy = 12
\]</span> which become <span class="math display">\[
yz = \lambda(2z + y)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
xz = \lambda(2z + x)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
xy = \lambda(2x + 2y)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
2xz + 2yz + xy = 12
\]</span> There are no general rules for solving systems of equations.
Sometimes some ingenuity is required. In the present example you might
notice that if we multiply (2) by <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, (3) by <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and (4) by <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, then the left sides of these equations
will be identical. Doing this, we have <span class="math display">\[
xyz = \lambda x(2z + y)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
xyz = \lambda y(2z + x)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
xyz = \lambda z(2x + 2y)
\]</span> We observe that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \neq
0\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0\)</span>
would imply <span class="math inline">\(yz = xz = xy = 0\)</span> from
(2), (3), and (4) and this would contradict (5). Therefore, from (6) and
(7), we have <span class="math display">\[
x(2z + y) = y(2z + x) \implies 2xz + xy = 2yz + xy \implies xz = yz
\]</span> But <span class="math inline">\(z \neq 0\)</span> (since <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0\)</span> would give <span
class="math inline">\(V = 0\)</span>), so <span class="math inline">\(x
= y\)</span>. From (7) and (8) we have <span class="math display">\[
y(2z + x) = z(2x + 2y) \implies 2yz + xy = 2xz + 2yz \implies xy = 2xz
\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(x \neq 0\)</span>, we have
<span class="math inline">\(y = 2z\)</span>. If we now put <span
class="math inline">\(x = y = 2z\)</span> in (5), we get <span
class="math display">\[
(2z)(2z) + 2(2z)z + 2(2z)z = 12 \implies 4z^2 + 4z^2 + 4z^2 = 12
\implies 12z^2 = 12
\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are all positive, we therefore have
<span class="math inline">\(z = 1\)</span> and so <span
class="math inline">\(x = 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y =
2\)</span>. This agrees with our answer in Section 14.7.</p>
