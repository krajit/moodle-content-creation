# Exercise 27

The total production P of a certain product depends on the amount L of labor used and the amount K of capital investment. In Sections 14.1 and 14.3 we discussed how the Cobb-Douglas model $P = bL^\alpha K^{1-\alpha}$ follows from certain economic assumptions, where b and $\alpha$ are positive constants and $\alpha < 1$. If the cost of a unit of labor is m and the cost of a unit of capital is n, and the company can spend only p dollars as its total budget, then maximizing the production P is subject to the constraint $mL + nK = p$. Show that the maximum production occurs when
$L = \frac{\alpha p}{m}$ and $K = \frac{(1-\alpha)p}{n}$

# Exercise 28

Referring to Exercise 27, we now suppose that the production is fixed at $bL^\alpha K^{1-\alpha} = Q$, where Q is a constant. What values of L and K minimize the cost function $C(L, K) = mL + nK$?
