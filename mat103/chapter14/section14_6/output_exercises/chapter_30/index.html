<p>Near a buoy, the depth of a lake at the point with coordinates <span
class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(z =
200 + 0.02x^2 - 0.001y^3\)</span>, where x, y, and z are measured in
meters. A fisherman in a small boat starts at the point <span
class="math inline">\((80, 60)\)</span> and moves toward the buoy, which
is located at <span class="math inline">\((0, 0)\)</span>. Is the water
under the boat getting deeper or shallower when he departs? Explain.</p>
