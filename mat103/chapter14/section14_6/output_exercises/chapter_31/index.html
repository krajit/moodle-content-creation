<p>The temperature T in a metal ball is inversely proportional to the
distance from the center of the ball, which we take to be the origin.
The temperature at the point <span class="math inline">\((1, 2,
2)\)</span> is 120Â°. (a) Find the rate of change of T at <span
class="math inline">\((1, 2, 2)\)</span> in the direction toward the
point <span class="math inline">\((2, 1, 3)\)</span>. (b) Show that at
any point in the ball the direction of greatest increase in temperature
is given by a vector that points toward the origin.</p>
