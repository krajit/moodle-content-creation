<p>Where does the helix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{r}(t) =
\langle \cos(\pi t), \sin(\pi t), t \rangle\)</span> intersect the
paraboloid <span class="math inline">\(z = x^2 + y^2\)</span>? What is
the angle of intersection between the helix and the paraboloid? (This is
the angle between the tangent vector to the curve and the tangent plane
to the paraboloid.)</p>
