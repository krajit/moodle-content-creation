<p>Suppose that the directional derivatives of <span
class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> are known at a given point in two
nonparallel directions given by unit vectors <strong>u</strong> and
<strong>v</strong>. Is it possible to find <span
class="math inline">\(\nabla f\)</span> at this point? If so, how would
you do it?</p>
