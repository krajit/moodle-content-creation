<p>Level curves for barometric pressure (in millibars) are shown for
6:00 AM on a day in November. A deep low with pressure 972 mb is moving
over northeast Iowa. The distance along the red line from K (Kearney,
Nebraska) to S (Sioux City, Iowa) is 300 km. Estimate the value of the
directional derivative of the pressure function at Kearney in the
direction of Sioux City. What are the units of the directional
derivative?</p>
