<p>The temperature at a point <span class="math inline">\((x, y,
z)\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(T(x, y, z) =
200e^{-x^2 - 3y^2 - 9z^2}\)</span> where T is measured in Â°C and x, y, z
in meters. (a) Find the rate of change of temperature at the point <span
class="math inline">\(P(2, -1, 2)\)</span> in the direction toward the
point <span class="math inline">\((3, -3, 3)\)</span>. (b) In which
direction does the temperature increase fastest at P? (c) Find the
maximum rate of increase at P.</p>
