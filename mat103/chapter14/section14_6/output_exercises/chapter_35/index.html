<p>Let f be a function of two variables that has continuous partial
derivatives and consider the points A(1, 3), B(3, 3), C(1, 7), and D(6,
15). The directional derivative of f at A in the direction of the vector
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{AB}\)</span> is 3 and the directional
derivative at A in the direction of <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{AC}\)</span> is 26. Find the directional
derivative of f at A in the direction of the vector <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{AD}\)</span>.</p>
