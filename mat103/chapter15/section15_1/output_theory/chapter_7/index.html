<p>Recall that it is usually difficult to evaluate single integrals
directly from the definition of an integral, but the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus provides a much easier method. The evaluation of double
integrals from first principles is even more difficult, but here we see
how to express a double integral as an <strong>iterated
integral</strong>, which can then be evaluated by calculating two single
integrals.</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a function of
two variables that is integrable on the rectangle <span
class="math inline">\(R = [a, b] \times [c, d]\)</span>. We use the
notation <span class="math inline">\(\int_c^d f(x, y) dy\)</span> to
mean that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is held fixed and <span
class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> is integrated with respect to
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(y = c\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y =
d\)</span>. This procedure is called <strong>partial integration with
respect to y</strong>. Now <span class="math inline">\(\int_c^d f(x, y)
dy\)</span> is a number that depends on the value of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, so it defines a function of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
A(x) = \int_c^d f(x, y) dy
\]</span> If we now integrate the function <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(x =
a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x = b\)</span>, we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \tag{7}
\int_a^b A(x) dx = \int_a^b \left[ \int_c^d f(x, y) dy \right] dx
\]</span></p>
<p>The integral on the right side of Equation (7)) is called an
<strong>iterated integral</strong>. Usually the brackets are omitted.
Thus</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \tag{8}
\int_a^b \int_c^d f(x, y) dy dx = \int_a^b \left[ \int_c^d f(x, y) dy
\right] dx
\]</span> means that we first integrate with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and then with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Similarly, the iterated integral <span class="math display">\[
\tag{eq:9}
\int_c^d \int_a^b f(x, y) dx dy = \int_c^d \left[ \int_a^b f(x, y) dx
\right] dy
\]</span> means that we first integrate with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (holding <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> fixed) from <span
class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x =
b\)</span> and then we integrate the resulting function of <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(y =
c\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y = d\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that in both Equations (8) and (9) we work from the inside
out.</p>
