<p>Graph the solid that lies between the surface <span
class="math inline">\(z = 2xy/(x^2 + 1)\)</span> and the plane <span
class="math inline">\(z = x + 2y\)</span> and is bounded by the planes
<span class="math inline">\(x = 0, x = 2, y = 0,\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 4\)</span>. Then find its volume.</p>
