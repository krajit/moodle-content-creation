<p>The following theorem gives a practical method for evaluating a
double integral by expressing it as an iterated integral (in either
order).</p>
<p><strong>10 Fubiniâ€™s Theorem</strong> If <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous on the rectangle <span
class="math inline">\(R = \{(x, y) | a \le x \le b, c \le y \le
d\}\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[
\iint_R f(x, y) dA = \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x, y) dy dx = \int_c^d \int_a^b
f(x, y) dx dy
\]</span> More generally, this is true if we assume that <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is bounded on <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
is discontinuous only on a finite number of smooth curves, and the
iterated integrals exist.</p>
