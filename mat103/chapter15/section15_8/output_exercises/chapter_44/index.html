<p>A model for the density <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>
of the earthâ€™s atmosphere near its surface is <span
class="math display">\[ \delta = 619.09 - 0.000097\rho \]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> (the distance from the center
of the earth) is measured in meters and <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is measured in kilograms per cubic
meter. If we take the surface of the earth to be a sphere with radius
6370 km, then this model is a reasonable one for <span
class="math inline">\(6.370 \times 10^6 \le \rho \le 6.375 \times
10^6\)</span>. Use this model to estimate the mass of the atmosphere
between the ground and an altitude of 5 km.</p>
