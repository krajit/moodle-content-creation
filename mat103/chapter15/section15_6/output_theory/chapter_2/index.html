<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous on the
rectangular box <span class="math inline">\(B = [a, b] \times [c, d]
\times [r, s]\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[
\iiint_B f(x, y, z) dV = \int_r^s \int_c^d \int_a^b f(x, y, z) dx dy dz
\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>The iterated integral on the right side of Fubini’s Theorem means
that we integrate first with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (keeping <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> fixed), then we integrate with respect
to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (keeping <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> fixed), and finally we integrate with
respect to <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. There are five other
possible orders in which we can integrate, all of which give the same
value. For instance, if we integrate with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, and then <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\iiint_B f(x, y, z) dV = \int_a^b \int_r^s \int_c^d f(x, y, z) dy dz dx
\]</span></p>
