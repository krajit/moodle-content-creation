<p>We define the triple integral over a general bounded region <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> in three-dimensional space (a solid) by
much the same procedure that we used for double integrals (15.2.2). We
enclose <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> in a box <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> of the type given by Equation 1. Then
we define <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> so that it agrees with
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> but is 0 for points in <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> that are outside <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. By definition, <span
class="math display">\[
\iiint_E f(x, y, z) dV = \iiint_B F(x, y, z) dV
\]</span> This integral exists if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
is continuous and the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>
is “reasonably smooth.” The triple integral has essentially the same
properties as the double integral (Properties 6–9 in Section 15.2).</p>
<p>We restrict our attention to continuous functions <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and to certain simple types of regions.
A solid region <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is said to be of
<strong>type 1</strong> if it lies between the graphs of two continuous
functions of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, that is, <span class="math display">\[
E = \{(x, y, z) | (x, y) \in D, u_1(x, y) \le z \le u_2(x, y)\}
\tag{5}
\]</span></p>
<p><img src="image-1.png" /></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the projection of
<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> onto the <span
class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane as shown in Figure 2. Notice
that the upper boundary of the solid <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the surface with equation <span
class="math inline">\(z = u_2(x, y)\)</span>, while the lower boundary
is the surface <span class="math inline">\(z = u_1(x, y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>By the same sort of argument that led to (15.2.3), it can be shown
that if <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is a type 1 region given
by Equation 5, then <span class="math display">\[
\iiint_E f(x, y, z) dV = \iint_D \left[ \int_{u_1(x,y)}^{u_2(x,y)} f(x,
y, z) dz \right] dA
\tag{6}
\]</span> The meaning of the inner integral on the right side of
Equation 6 is that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are held fixed, and therefore <span
class="math inline">\(u_1(x, y)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(u_2(x, y)\)</span> are regarded as constants,
while <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y, z)\)</span> is integrated with
respect to <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p>In particular, if the projection <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> onto the <span
class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane is a type I plane region (as in
Figure 3), then</p>
<p><img src="image-2.png" /></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E = \{(x, y, z) | a \le x \le b, g_1(x) \le y \le g_2(x), u_1(x, y) \le
z \le u_2(x, y)\}
\]</span> and Equation 6 becomes <span class="math display">\[
\iiint_E f(x, y, z) dV = \int_a^b \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)}
\int_{u_1(x,y)}^{u_2(x,y)} f(x, y, z) dz dy dx
\tag{7}
\]</span> If, on the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>
is a type II plane region (as in Figure 4), then</p>
<p><img src="image-3.png" /></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E = \{(x, y, z) | c \le y \le d, h_1(y) \le x \le h_2(y), u_1(x, y) \le
z \le u_2(x, y)\}
\]</span> and Equation 6 becomes <span class="math display">\[
\iiint_E f(x, y, z) dV = \int_c^d \int_{h_1(y)}^{h_2(y)}
\int_{u_1(x,y)}^{u_2(x,y)} f(x, y, z) dz dx dy
\tag{8}
\]</span></p>
