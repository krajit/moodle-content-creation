<p>For single integrals, the region over which we integrate is always an
interval. But for double integrals, we want to be able to integrate a
function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> not just over rectangles
but also over regions <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> of more
general shape, such as the one illustrated in Figure 1.</p>
<p><img src="image.png" /></p>
<p>We suppose that <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is a bounded
region, which means that <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> can be
enclosed in a rectangular region <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
as in Figure 2. Then we define a new function <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> with domain <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[
F(x, y) =
\begin{cases}
f(x, y) &amp; \text{if } (x, y) \text{ is in } D \\
0 &amp; \text{if } (x, y) \text{ is in } R \text{ but not in } D
\end{cases}
\tag{1}
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is integrable over <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, then we define the <strong>double
integral of f over D</strong> by <span class="math display">\[
\iint_D f(x, y) dA = \iint_R F(x, y) dA
\tag{2}
\]</span> where F is given by Equation 1.</p>
<p>In the case where <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y) \ge 0\)</span>,
we can still interpret <span class="math inline">\(\iint_D f(x, y)
dA\)</span> as the volume of the solid that lies above <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and under the surface <span
class="math inline">\(z = f(x, y)\)</span> (the graph of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>). You can see that this is reasonable
by comparing the graphs of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> in Figures 3 and 4 and
remembering that <span class="math inline">\(\iint_R F(x, y) dA\)</span>
is the volume under the graph of <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="image-1.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 4 also shows that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is
likely to have discontinuities at the boundary points of <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Nonetheless, if <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous on <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and the boundary curve of <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is “well behaved” (in a sense outside
the scope of this book), then it can be shown that <span
class="math inline">\(\iint_R F(x, y) dA\)</span> exists and therefore
<span class="math inline">\(\iint_D f(x, y) dA\)</span> exists. In
particular, this is the case for the following two types of regions.</p>
