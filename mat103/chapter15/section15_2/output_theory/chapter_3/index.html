<p>A plane region <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is said to be
of <strong>type I</strong> if it lies between the graphs of two
continuous functions of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, that is,
<span class="math display">\[
D = \{(x, y) | a \le x \le b, g_1(x) \le y \le g_2(x)\}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g_2\)</span> are continuous on <span
class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span>. Some examples of type I regions
are shown in Figure below.</p>
<p><img src="image-2.png" /></p>
<p>In order to evaluate <span class="math inline">\(\iint_D f(x, y)
dA\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is a region of
type I, we choose a rectangle <span class="math inline">\(R = [a, b]
\times [c, d]\)</span> that contains <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, as in Figure 6, and we let <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the function given by Equation 1;
that is, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> agrees with <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is 0 outside <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Then, by Fubiniâ€™s Theorem, <span
class="math display">\[
\iint_D f(x, y) dA = \iint_R F(x, y) dA = \int_a^b \int_c^d F(x, y) dy
dx
\]</span> Observe that <span class="math inline">\(F(x, y) = 0\)</span>
if <span class="math inline">\(y &lt; g_1(x)\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(y &gt; g_2(x)\)</span> because <span
class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> then lies outside <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Therefore <span
class="math display">\[
\int_c^d F(x, y) dy = \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} F(x, y) dy =
\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} f(x, y) dy
\]</span> because <span class="math inline">\(F(x, y) = f(x, y)\)</span>
when <span class="math inline">\(g_1(x) \le y \le g_2(x)\)</span>. Thus
we have the following formula that enables us to evaluate the double
integral as an iterated integral.</p>
<p>If f is continuous on a type I region <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
D = \{(x, y) | a \le x \le b, g_1(x) \le y \le g_2(x)\},
\]</span> then <span class="math display">\[
\iint_D f(x, y) dA = \int_a^b \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} f(x, y) dy dx
\tag{3}
\]</span> The integral on the right side of (3) is an iterated integral
that is similar to the ones we considered in the preceding section,
except that in the inner integral we regard <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as being constant not only in <span
class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> but also in the limits of
integration, <span class="math inline">\(g_1(x)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g_2(x)\)</span>.</p>
