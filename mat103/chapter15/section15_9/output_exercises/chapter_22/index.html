<p>An important problem in thermodynamics is to find the work done by an
ideal Carnot engine. A cycle consists of alternating expansion and
compression of gas in a piston. The work done by the engine is equal to
the area of the region R enclosed by two isothermal curves <span
class="math inline">\(xy=a, xy=b\)</span> and two adiabatic curves <span
class="math inline">\(xy^{1.4}=c, xy^{1.4}=d\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; a &lt; b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; c &lt; d\)</span>. Compute the work done by
determining the area of R.</p>
