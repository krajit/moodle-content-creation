<p>Cylindrical coordinates are useful in problems that involve symmetry
about an axis, and the z-axis is chosen to coincide with this axis of
symmetry. For instance, the axis of the circular cylinder with Cartesian
equation <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 = c^2\)</span> is the
z-axis. In cylindrical coordinates this cylinder has the very simple
equation <span class="math inline">\(r=c\)</span>. (See Figure 4.) This
is the reason for the name “cylindrical” coordinates.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 2</strong> Describe the surface whose equation in
cylindrical coordinates is <span class="math inline">\(z=r\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p><img src="image-4.png" /></p>
<p>The equation says that the z-value, or height, of each point on the
surface is the same as r, the distance from the point to the z-axis.
Because <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> doesn’t appear, it
can vary. So any horizontal trace in the plane <span
class="math inline">\(z=k\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(k&gt;0\)</span>) is a circle of radius k. These
traces suggest that the surface is a cone. This prediction can be
confirmed by converting the equation into rectangular coordinates. From
the first equation in (2) we have <span class="math display">\[
z^2 = r^2 = x^2 + y^2
\]</span> We recognize the equation <span class="math inline">\(z^2 =
x^2 + y^2\)</span> (by comparison with Table 1 in Section 12.6) as being
a circular cone whose axis is the z-axis (see Figure 5).</p>
