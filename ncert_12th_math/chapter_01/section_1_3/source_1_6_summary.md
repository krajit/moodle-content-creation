In this chapter, we studied different types of relations and equivalence relation, composition of functions, invertible functions and binary operations. The main features of this chapter are as follows:

- **Empty relation** is the relation $R$ in $X$ given by $R = \phi \subseteq X \times X$.
- **Universal relation** is the relation $R$ in $X$ given by $R = X \times X$.
- **Reflexive relation** $R$ in $X$ is a relation with $(a, a) \in R\ \forall a \in X$.
- **Symmetric relation** $R$ in $X$ is a relation satisfying $(a, b) \in R \Rightarrow (b, a) \in R$.
- **Transitive relation** $R$ in $X$ is a relation satisfying $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, c) \in R$ implies that $(a, c) \in R$.
- **Equivalence relation** $R$ in $X$ is a relation which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
- **Equivalence class** $[a]$ containing $a \in X$ for an equivalence relation $R$ in $X$ is the subset of $X$ containing all elements related to $a$.

- A function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is **one-one** (or injective) if  
  $$
  f(x_1) = f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2,\ \forall\ x_1, x_2 \in X.
  $$

- A function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is **onto** (or surjective) if given any $y \in Y$, $\exists\ x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.

- A function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is **one-one and onto** (or bijective), if $f$ is both one-one and onto.

- Given a finite set $X$, a function $f : X \rightarrow X$ is one-one (respectively onto) if and only if $f$ is onto (respectively one-one). This is the characteristic property of a finite set. This is not true for infinite set.
