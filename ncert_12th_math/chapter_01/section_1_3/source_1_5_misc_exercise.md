# Exercise 1

Show that the function $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \{x \in \mathbb{R} : -1 < x < 1\}$ defined by  
   $$
   f(x) = \frac{-x}{1 + |x|},\quad x \in \mathbb{R}
   $$  
   is one-one and onto function.

# Exercise 3

Given a non-empty set $X$, consider $P(X)$ which is the set of all subsets of $X$.  

Define the relation $R$ in $P(X)$ as follows:  
   For subsets $A, B$ in $P(X)$, $A R B$ if and only if $A \subseteq B$.  
   Is $R$ an equivalence relation on $P(X)$? Justify your answer.

# Exercise 5

Let $A = \{-1, 0, 1, 2\}$, $B = \{-4, -2, 0, 2\}$ and $f, g : A \rightarrow B$ be functions defined by  
$$
   f(x) = x^2 - x,\quad x \in A
   $$  
   and  
   $$
   g(x) = 2\left\lfloor x - \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor,\quad x \in A.
   $$  
   Are $f$ and $g$ equal?  
   Justify your answer. (Hint: One may note that two functions $f : A \rightarrow B$ and $g : A \rightarrow B$ such that $f(a) = g(a)\ \forall\ a \in A$, are called equal functions).
